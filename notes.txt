types of http calls:

last_played = returns the track info for the last played song, or will communicate that the file doesn't exist
list_albums = returns all albums and tracks, including singles, in proper json
search = client provides search string, server returns all results, including individual songs and albums
artist_page = client provides artist string, server returns all details for the page
play_pause = self explanatory
seek_track = reposition timing within song to new point
next_song = self explanatory
previous_song = self explanatory
get_lyrics = self explanatory, but will retrieve lyrics maybe from genius or something? will say if no internet access
add_queue = add a particular track to the queue
back (and forward) = rewind history or move ahead in history, client will make any repeat calls if needed for content
get_settings = all current settings will be provided by the server
set_settings = client will relay the new settings back to the server to store and take effect
home = retrieve info for the home page



further notes:
showing the now playing view does not require an http request, as requesting the
    current song and all the albums will give the client access to the cover art
when the main page updates, or the location of a song is checked, update the album
    view to reflect the current song being looked at (should happen when the content changes)
opening an album (or singles, or queue) will not require an http request since we have that info
